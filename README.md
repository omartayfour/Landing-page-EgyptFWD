## Instructions

This is my version of the Landing Page project which required tested our skills in manipulating the DOM. The added functionalities in the Landing page are:

* Navbar which directs user to sections.
* Button which shows in the bottom right corner to direct user back to top of page.
* Active state when user is viewing a certain section. (Done in both cases of using navbar or simply scrolling)
* Collapsible/Expandable sections

## Javascript

The javascript file is throughly commented. The code is divided into 4 sections which are:

* Global variables
* Helper functions
* Main functions
* Event listeners
* Function Calls

The description for each variable/function/event listener is provided above each of them in the javascript file.
